### Project Scaffolding Framework

To set up the scaffolding for the Amber Project, we have established a structured framework that supports the development and integration of programming project prompts:

#### 1. Directory Structure
```
/amber-project
├── docs
│   ├── index.md
│   └── prompts
│       └── meta_prompts.md
├── scripts
│   └── enforce_quality.py
├── src
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
├── tests
│   ├── test_main.py
│   └── test_utils.py
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── ci.yml
└── README.md
```

#### 2. Configuration Files
- **Dependencies Management**: `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies or `package.json` for Node.js
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings and variables
- **Build Configuration**: Project build and compilation settings

#### 3. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
**Implementation**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Pipeline Steps**:
- Code linting (e.g., Pylint for Python)
- Running automated tests (e.g., PyTest for Python)
- Building the project
- Quality gate enforcement

#### 4. Documentation Framework
**Components**:
- **Project Overview**: Comprehensive description in `README.md`
- **Setup Instructions**: Detailed environment setup and execution guide
- **API Documentation**: Interface documentation where applicable
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design and component interaction

#### 5. Testing Framework
**Implementation**: 
- **Python**: PyTest framework for unit and integration tests
- **JavaScript**: Jest framework for comprehensive testing
- **Test Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting and thresholds

#### 6. Version Control Strategy
**System**: Git with consistent branching strategy
- **Branching Model**: Git Flow or GitHub Flow
- **Commit Standards**: Conventional commit messages
- **Code Review Process**: Pull request workflows

#### 7. Quality Gates
**Implementation**: CI pipeline quality enforcement
- **Code Standards**: Predefined coding standards compliance
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds
- **Security Checks**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Performance regression detection

#### 8. Monitoring and Logging Infrastructure
**Tools and Systems**:
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics collection
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation
- **Performance Tracking**: Application performance monitoring
- **Error Reporting**: Automated error detection and alerting

This scaffolding framework provides excellent developer experience, performance monitoring, and scalability for the Amber Project development lifecycle.
