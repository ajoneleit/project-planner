- Security measures will be applied to specific systems and applications as identified in the project documentation, including but not limited to user authentication systems, data storage solutions, and communication protocols.
- Compliance requirements and standards to adhere to will be specified based on the systems and applications involved, including GDPR for data protection and PCI DSS for payment processing.
- Use OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure access management, ensuring that user credentials are not directly handled by the application.
- Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- Use TLS 1.3 for transport security to ensure secure communication channels between clients and servers, minimizing the risk of eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.



## Executive Summary
**Added 2025-08-13 15:40:24 by UnknownUsertest-user:**
The current project aims to enhance the security posture of specific systems and applications by implementing robust security measures that comply with relevant standards and regulations. The scope includes the integration of advanced authentication protocols, data encryption techniques, and secure communication channels to protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with frameworks such as GDPR for data protection and PCI DSS for payment processing. The project is currently in the planning phase, with detailed security requirements outlined to guide the implementation process.

Key requirements include the adoption of OAuth 2.0 for secure access management, AES-256 encryption for safeguarding data both at rest and in transit, and the utilization of TLS 1.3 to establish secure communication between clients and servers. These measures are critical for mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations. The successful execution of these security protocols is essential for maintaining stakeholder trust and safeguarding the organizationâ€™s reputation.

However, the project faces challenges such as ensuring seamless integration of new security measures with existing systems and managing potential disruptions during implementation. To address these challenges, the project team will prioritize stakeholder engagement and thorough testing of security protocols. The next steps involve finalizing the implementation plan, conducting risk assessments, and establishing a timeline for deployment to ensure that all security measures are effectively integrated and operational by the targeted deadlines.
